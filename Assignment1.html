//  Q.1 What are the different data types present in javascript ?
//  Ans - 1. Primitive types
//         String
//         Number
//         BigInt
//         Boolean
//         Undefined
//         Null
//         Symbol
//         2.Non-Primitive types
//         Object
// Q.2 What are the JavaScript Engines ?
//     Now to run JavaScript code we need javaScript engine, Before it was believed that javaScript code can be run only 
//     in browser and only client side applications can be created.
//     So all the browsers are having their own JS engines to run JS code.
//     Later Ryan Dahl wrote some C++ and tried to run it using JS Engine, and it worked and we call it Node.JS.
//     So JS can be used for client-side application and server-side application as well, it just requires JS engine to run the code.

//     in Simple Word JavaScript is a scripting language and is not directly understood by computer but the browsers have inbuilt JavaScript
//     engine which help them to understand and interpret JavaScript codes.These engines help to convert our JavaScript
//     program into computer - understandable language.

// Q.3  Explain ECMA in JS.
//     The Full form of ECMA is European Computer Manufacturer’s Association
//     ECMAScript is a scripting-language specification that was developed by ECMA International in order to create a standardized JavaScript implementation across all web browsers.
//     It is widely used for client-side scripting in web browsers, and it is also used for server-side scripting with node. js

// Q.4  Why We use JavaScript ?
//     JavaScript is a scripting language used to develop web pages. Developed in Netscape,
//     JavaScript allows developers to create a dynamic and interactive web page to interact with visitors and execute complex actions.
//     It also enables users to load content into a document without reloading the entire page.

// Q.5  What is JavaScript? And also Explain the histroy of JavaScript?
//     JavaScript is a light-weight object-oriented programming language which is used by several websites for scripting the webpages.
//     It is an interpreted, full-fledged programming language that enables dynamic interactivity on websites when applied to an HTML document.
//     It was introduced in the year 1995 for adding programs to the webpages in the Netscape Navigator browser.
//     Since then, it has been adopted by all other graphical web browsers. With JavaScript, users can build modern web applications to interact directly without reloading the page every time.
//     The traditional website uses javaScript to provide several forms of interactivity and simplicity.

// Q.6 What is DOM in js?
//     The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML(Extensible markup language) documents.
//     It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
//     It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesn’t specify any relationship between objects.
